<p>“<strong>The Impact of the 340B Drug Pricing Program on Critical Access Hospitals: Evidence from Medicare Part B</strong>” (<em>Job Market Paper</em>)<br>
Abstract: The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows qualifying public and not-for-profit hospitals to acquire most outpatient drugs from manufacturers with sizable discounts. Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended hospital eligibility for 340B, over 1,000 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) have joined the program. Because CAHs are reimbursed by Medicare at 101% of costs, they receive less payment per outpatient drug covered by Medicare Part B under 340B. This creates a unique circumstance in which both the behavioral response of CAHs and its implications for their patients are not well understood. Exploiting the ACA&rsquo;s 340B expansion and leveraging the geographic variation in the outpatient market share of CAHs via a difference-in-difference (DD) framework, I find that allowing CAHs to participate in 340B led to a significant reduction in total payment and beneficiary cost sharing for Part B drugs per patient without noticeable effect on Part B drug utilization. Since Part B coinsurance at CAHs is based on charges (list prices set by hospitals) instead of total payment, I show that the observed reduction in beneficiary cost sharing under 340B was driven by CAHs reducing outpatient drug charges upon becoming eligible for 340B (DD) and participating in 340B (event study). I argue that the pass-through of 340B discounts to patients was not financially motivated.</p>
<p>“<strong>Hospital Financial Performance Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program - a Tale of Multi-Payer System</strong>”<br>
Abstract: The 340B Drug Pricing Program requires drug manufacturers to offer price discounts on most outpatient drugs to certain health care providers. With hospital participation in the 340B program growing rapidly in recent years, policy makers increasingly question whether the program benefits hospitals or patients. However, the financial implications of 340B differ widely depending on how hospitals are reimbursed – the typical acute care hospitals often get to keep all of the discounts as extra profit due to payments being fixed at prospective rates, but hospitals known as the Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) are primarily reimbursed based on costs and therefore must pass along some or most of the discounts to insurers or patients. In this paper, I investigate the net effect of the 340B program on hospital financial outcomes using event study method that leverages the variation in the timing that a hospital joins 340B. I find that participating in 340B leads to no change in hospital costs associated with outpatient drugs but increases in overall profit margin, total profits, and pharmacy staffing among non-CAH hospitals, which is consistent with the strong profit incentives created by the price discounts and fixed payment rates. On the other hand, upon joining 340B, CAHs experience a decrease in hospital costs associated with outpatient drugs, no change to profit margin, a decrease in total profits, and a small increase in pharmacy staffing, which is in line with the much muted incentives in this setting. I further show that CAHs participate in 340B likely as a result of rising drug costs and declining cash reserves. While the gain in profits for non-CAH hospitals does not translate into an increase in the offering of unprofitable services such as psychiatric emergency services, the reduction in profits for CAHs spill over to a reduction in the offering of these services. As a complementary approach, I estimate similar effects for non-CAH hospitals using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design that exploits an eligibility threshold specific to these hospitals. These results suggest limited pass-through of 340B discounts to patients among typical acute care hospitals, and raise questions about the long-term financial implications of 340B on CAHs.</p>
