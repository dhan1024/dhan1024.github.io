<p>“<strong>The Impact of the 340B Drug Pricing Program on Critical Access Hospitals: Evidence from Medicare Part B</strong>” (<em>Job Market Paper</em>)<br>
Abstract: Abstract The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows qualifying public and not-for-profit hospitals to acquire most outpatient drugs from manufacturers with sizable discounts. Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded 340B eligibility to most Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) in 2010, over 1,000 CAHs have joined the program, making up nearly half of all 340B-participating hospitals. Unlike typical acute care hospitals, CAHs participating in the 340B program do not obtain greater Medicare margins on Part B covered drugs despite the price discounts, and the response of CAHs to 340B and its implications for the patients they serve have gathered little attention. In this study, I investigate the impact of the ACA&rsquo;s 340B expansion to CAHs on Part B drug utilization and spending by leveraging the geographic variation in the outpatient market share of CAHs using a difference-in-difference (DD) method. I find that allowing CAHs to participate in 340B led to significant reductions in total payment and patient cost sharing for Part B drugs without noticeable effect on drug utilization. Since Part B coinsurance for CAH services is based on charges (list prices set by hospitals), I show that the observed reduction in patient cost sharing was indeed driven by a reduction in outpatient drug charges among CAHs upon becoming eligible for 340B (DD) or participating in 340B (event study). I discuss several potential mechanisms for the reduction in drug charges.</p>
<p>“<strong>Hospital Financial Performance Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program - a Tale of Multi-Payer System</strong>”<br>
Abstract: The 340B Drug Pricing Program requires drug manufacturers to offer price discounts on most outpatient drugs to certain health care providers. With hospital participation in the 340B program growing rapidly in recent years, policy makers increasingly question whether the program benefits hospitals or patients. However, the financial implications of 340B differ widely depending on how hospitals are reimbursed – the typical acute care hospitals often get to keep all of the discounts as extra profit due to payments being fixed at prospective rates, but hospitals known as the Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) are primarily reimbursed based on costs and therefore must pass along some or most of the discounts to insurers or patients. In this paper, I investigate the net effect of the 340B program on hospital financial outcomes using event study method that leverages the variation in the timing that a hospital joins 340B. I find that participating in 340B leads to no change in hospital costs associated with outpatient drugs but increases in overall profit margin, total profits, and pharmacy staffing among non-CAH hospitals, which is consistent with the strong profit incentives created by the price discounts and fixed payment rates. On the other hand, upon joining 340B, CAHs experience a decrease in hospital costs associated with outpatient drugs, no change to profit margin, a decrease in total profits, and a small increase in pharmacy staffing, which is in line with the much muted incentives in this setting. I further show that CAHs participate in 340B likely as a result of rising drug costs and declining cash reserves. While the gain in profits for non-CAH hospitals does not translate into an increase in the offering of unprofitable services such as psychiatric emergency services, the reduction in profits for CAHs spill over to a reduction in the offering of these services. As a complementary approach, I estimate similar effects for non-CAH hospitals using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design that exploits an eligibility threshold specific to these hospitals. These results suggest limited pass-through of 340B discounts to patients among typical acute care hospitals, and raise questions about the long-term financial implications of 340B on CAHs.</p>
