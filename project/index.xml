      <description>Roughly 45% of US hospitals participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which entitles participants to steep discounts for purchasing most outpatient drugs. Due to different underlying payment structure and payer mix, the financial implication of 340B could differ widely based on whether a hospital is a typical acute care hospital or a Critical Access Hospital (CAH). In this work, I seek to quantify the financial impact of 340B on hospitals and capture intra-hospital spillover by studying hospital pharmacy staffing and service offering.</description>

      <description>The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows qualifying public and not-for-profit providers to acquire most outpatient drugs from manufacturers at discounted prices. Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended 340B eligibility, over 1,000 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) have joined the program. Because CAHs are reimbursed by Medicare at 101% of costs, they receive less payment per Medicare Part B drug under 340B, which leads to unique incentives of which the impact and implication are not well understood.</description>
