      <description>Working Papers “The Impact of the 340B Drug Pricing Program on Critical Access Hospitals: Evidence from Medicare Part B” (Job Market Paper)
Abstract: The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows qualifying public and not-for-profit hospitals to acquire most outpatient drugs from manufacturers with sizable discounts. Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended hospital eligibility for 340B, over 1,000 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) have joined the program. Because CAHs are reimbursed by Medicare at 101% of costs, they receive less payment per outpatient drug covered by Medicare Part B under 340B.</description>
